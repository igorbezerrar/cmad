# CMAD: A Dataset of Conflicting Marks from the Brazilian Intellectual Property Office

This code was used to create the CMAD (acronym for Conflicting Marks Archive Dataset), which is a dataset focused on litigation cases for trademark similarity experiments. This dataset has been meticulously organized into pairs of marks involved in conflicts of copyright infringement between word, figurative and mixed marks. Marks sought registration with the National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI) in Brazil, and had their applications denied after analysis by intellectual property specialists.
